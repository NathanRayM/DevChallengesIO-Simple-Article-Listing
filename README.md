Simple Article Listing
Code a simple article listing challenge with HTML and CSS to practice flexbox and working with article elements.

### What I learned

Iâ€™ve become increasingly comfortable working with Flexbox, so I used this project as an opportunity to implement a mobile-first workflow from the start.

### Built with

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- Mobile first
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

## Acknowledgements

For the most part, I worked through this off of memory and trial and error.
